##### Primary configuration settings #####
##########################################
# This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of the Salt Master.
# Values that are commented out but have an empty line after the comment are
# defaults that do not need to be set in the config. If there is no blank line
# after the comment then the value is presented as an example and is not the
# default.

# The root directory prepended to these options: pki_dir, cachedir,
# sock_dir, log_file, autosign_file, autoreject_file, extension_modules,
# key_logfile, pidfile:

# PurePOC /etc/salt is a symbolic link that points to /purepoc/etc/salt
root_dir: /purepoc/master_config



# Enable "open mode", this mode still maintains encryption, but turns off
# authentication, this is only intended for highly secure environments or for
# the situation where your keys end up in a bad state. If you run in open mode
# you do so at your own risk!
open_mode: True

# Enable auto_accept, this setting will automatically accept all incoming
# public keys from the minions. Note that this is insecure.
auto_accept: True






#####         Node Groups           ######
##########################################
# Node groups allow for logical groupings of minion nodes. A group consists of
# a group name and a compound target. Nodgroups can reference other nodegroups
# with 'N@' classifier. Ensure that you do not have circular references.
#
#nodegroups:
#  group1: 'L@foo.domain.com,bar.domain.com,baz.domain.com or bl*.domain.com'
#  group2: 'G@os:Debian and foo.domain.com'
#  group3: 'G@os:Debian and N@group1'
#  group4:
#    - 'G@foo:bar'
#    - 'or'
#    - 'G@foo:baz'
